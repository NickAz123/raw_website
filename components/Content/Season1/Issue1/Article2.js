          <p>Hey you,</p>

          <p>Hope all is well with everything going on in your life. I’m currently sitting at a local coffee shop after riding my bike mostly suffering from the steep incline and decline just to satisfy my breakfast sandwich cravings. Though the one I had I’d say was almost really good. Like it was good, but it needed acid. Something about a milk bun, mayo and a fried egg screams the need for ketchup. On a side note, my relationship with ketchup has been a lot better ever since I started buying the French’s Ketchup instead of the Heinz brand. </p>

          <p>Anyway, I want to talk about something I’ve realized over the past couple weeks. I’ve always been surrounded by people who smoke, vape, and everything within its similarities. Maybe it’s the industry that I’m in that I’ve seen this more evidently. </p>

          <p>During dinner service I went out to the back deck of the restaurant for my daily protein shake intake at around 8PM and met a couple of my colleagues there. </p>

          <p><i>“Could I bum a stick off you? I left mine inside.”</i></p>

          <p><i>“Don’t you owe me, like 15? Anyway, here.”</i></p>

          <p><i>“Could I also borrow a light?”</i></p>

          <p>I wondered if they sort of had a system of “borrowing” cigarettes since 15 of anything seems like a big ask. Is there some sort of unspoken rule that I’m not aware about? Again, I don’t smoke or anything so I don’t really know how expensive or inexpensive cigarettes could be. I just know that Canada doesn’t sell any Marlboro Reds and that it's a HOT commodity around here.</p>

          <p>But what was interesting to me is that the people I know that smoke are one of the most genuine and generous people that I know. I had to ask if they keep tabs on each other regarding how many they’ve bummed off or how many were bummed off of them and based on this conversation alone, they really don’t. My friend at work says that whenever he buys himself a pack, he usually buys an extra one just because he knows that people are bound to ask each other for a dart. Another friend mentioned that if he feels like he’s bummed a couple of darts that equate to a pack, he’ll just buy an extra pack to give him. This entire exchange, as mentioned earlier, speaks of immense levels of <span><b>genuineness, comradery, community</b></span> as well as <span><b>generosity</b></span>. There’s trust that’s built. </p>

          <p>I was talking to one of my best friends about this topic of a newsletter that I’m currently writing and he seems excited to read about it. He mentioned that whenever he smokes in front of someone, out of courtesy, he’d immediately offer a cigarette to them unless he fully knows that the person he’s with doesn’t smoke. Or if you’re his homie, you could take a hit from his last cigarette. Speaking of last cigarettes, I learned to NEVER ask for the last cigarette since the last one always hits differently.</p>

          <p>Circling back to the topic of Marlboro Reds, my good friend, Jules, asked me to get him some since I was about to fly back home to Manila for a quick trip. Without fail, this guy texts me every day greeting me with a “Good morning.” This was the closest thing I got to remembering what it feels like to have a girlfriend. I did give him a reel of Reds and in exchange he gave me <b>four joints</b>. I never understood why he wanted it so badly until I remembered that they don’t sell Marlboro Reds here for reasons I thought I knew. I thought it was for the same reason Canada stopped selling menthols which was to reduce the number of smokers but it’s purely a trademarking issue. I won’t go too crazy into detail, I just thought they stopped selling Reds here purely to prevent the increase of smokers but really it’s a trademark issue. In summary, they still sell Reds, just under the name “Rootop” which apparently still feels like your smoking lights. Think Coca-Cola vs the Coca-Cola you’d get in Mexico or in Asia. <b>It hits, but the latter hits slightly better</b>. </p>
          
          <p>All I’m trying to say is that we could learn a couple of things from those who smoke. From the conversations deriving from it, to learning how to be genuine as well as being generous.</p>

          <p>
          We hope you enjoyed this newsletter and we’ll catch you on the next one.
          </p>

          <p>With respect,</p>

          <p>Rico, Random-Ass Wednesday</p>
