            I just finished watching The Bear on FX, <i>illegally</i>, and I
            cannot stress how much of a perfect show this is despite watching
            the harsh, unfiltered, soul-crushing realities of what could be
            happening behind the counters of our favorite restaurants. It’s the
            perfect mix for reality with a dramatic pinch of exaggeration.
            <b>
              {" "}
              I’m not here to give a review on the show, I’m here to simply just
              talk about it.&nbsp;
            </b>
            Being vulnerable, I’ve re-written this letter twice, as well as
            encountered a minor breakdown only because this industry is my life
            and I want to be able to fully encapsulate it in the way that I see
            it. I don’t want to talk about food, I want to talk about the areas
            in this show that some people would tend to overlook.{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            I highly suggest all my friends and family to take the time to watch
            this show.{" "}

            **SPOILERS AHEAD**
          </p>

          <p>
            To provide context, it’s about a young chef, Carmy, leaving the
            fine-dining scene (best restaurant in the world) and moving back to
            Chicago to take over his family sandwich shop after his older
            brother passed away.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now this family restaurant is your typical local community joint
            sustained by untrained cooks coming from different backgrounds all
            with their own struggles and stories, just like everyone else.
            <i> It’s the most normal shit ever. </i>
          </p>

          <p>
            As I was watching, I caught myself getting distracted or pausing
            because I couldn’t bear to look at what was and is familiar to me.
            Whether it was the constant yelling of <b>“BEHIND”</b> or{" "}
            <b>“CORNER”</b>, drinking water out of liter containers, the
            importance of family/staff meals, the immense amount of cigarettes,
            and that one guy that just knows how to fix things.{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            The show highlights the anxieties, addictions, coping mechanisms
            that a lot of cooks face on a day to day basis and how it’s being
            managed. In episode 7, you’ll see what I mean. Episode 7 is the
            perfect description of how a perfectly normal day could immediately
            turn into a <i>melting pot of utter shit and chaotic distress. </i>
          </p>

          <p>
            There’s a lot to unpack after watching the Bear twice. Once for
            entertainment, second to study. Just to put this out there, it was
            kind of the first time I saw myself in a fictional tv character. Off
            the bat you can really tell that Carmy has not only an eye for food
            and its quality, but also has an eye for just really nice things.
            For example, in the beginning you see Carmy dealing with vintage
            americana. If you really want to dig deep, the restaurant scene has
            a nice pocket of cooks and chefs with incredible taste. You can see
            Carmy’s work uniform starting with his Birkenstock Tokio Super Grips
            paired with not just any white t-shirt, but it’s gotta be either{" "}
            <b>Velva Sheen, Shwanen, or Whitesville</b> noticing that Carmy’s
            t-shirt had a tubular fit on it. We’re talking $300 in work
            uniforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>It’s triggering, yet cathartic.</b> Triggering because last
            summer I wanted k*ll myself, cathartic because it was comforting to
            know that I wasn’t alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Triggering because it brought me back to the time I was pulling in
            at least 55-60 hours weekly, not having control over what bullshit
            could happen during the day, or how I was meant to be learning but
            somehow felt the entire restaurant was resting on my shoulders
            thinking{" "}
            <i>“will this even lead me anywhere? Is this still worth it?”</i> Or
            moments where I found myself in the walk-in cooler having a
            breakdown mid-service whilst eating a freezie. I was fresh out of
            culinary school and was offered a junior-sous chef position at a
            restaurant that was failing internally. We were probably doing at
            least 250 covers daily with only 3 or 4 cooks and only 2 hours of
            prep time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cathartic because it provided me comfort knowing that everyone was
            going through it, everyone was a ticking time-bomb awaiting to break
            loose. I was at the restaurant more than I was at home, I saw my
            team more than I saw my family; <b>these cooks became my family.</b>{" "}
            At this point, I felt an intense growth in camaraderie and trust
            that was built during this season in my life. Comforting because
            this is a specific experience that I can only share with my peers
            and superiors who were with me during this season. Comforting
            because this is an experience only a few can relate to.
          </p>

          <p>
            There’s a lot of yelling, burns, cuts, scars and tattoos which is
            probably the forefront of what most people would see as cooks or
            chefs but it’s deeper than that. It’s the cuts and scars that people
            <b> don’t see</b> — the trauma, the insecurities, the constant state
            of anxiety and panic that you bear as you sweat your ass off behind
            the line. There were also a couple of small details in the show that
            made me go <i>“yup, felt that.”</i> Like when Carmy was drinking
            water out of a liter container or when he made himself a “whatever’s
            in my fridge sandwich” and called it a night. Details like this
            bring me so much comfort because there’s so much more to restaurant
            life than just cooking. When you watch The Bear, you’re watching an
            authentic depiction of the literal day in the life of a cook.
          </p>

          <p>
            With that said, <b>cooks are cool.</b> But a lot of us are also{" "}
            <b>mentally deranged.</b>
