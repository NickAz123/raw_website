          <p>I just finished watching The Bear on FX, <i>illegally</i>, and I cannot stress how much of a perfect show this is despite watching the harsh, unfiltered, soul-crushing realities of what could be happening behind the counters of our favorite restaurants. I’m not here to give a review on the show, I’m here to simply just talk about it. </p>

          <p>I highly suggest all my friends and family to take the time to watch this show. </p>

          <p><b>**SPOILERS AHEAD**</b></p>

          <p>To provide a better understanding as to what the show’s about, it’s about a young chef, Carmy, leaving the fine-dining scene (best restaurant in the world) and moving back to Chicago to take over his family sandwich shop after his older brother passed away.</p>

          <p>Now this family restaurant is your typical local community joint sustained by untrained cooks coming from different backgrounds all with their own struggles and stories, just like everyone else. It’s the most normal shit ever.</p>

          <p>As I was watching the series, I caught myself getting distracted or pausing because I couldn’t bear to look at what was and is familiar to me. Whether it was the constant yelling of “behind” or “corner”, drinking water out of liter containers, the importance of family/staff meals, the immense amount of cigarettes, and that one guy that just knows how to fix things. </p>

          <p>The show highlights the anxieties, addictions, coping mechanisms that a lot of cooks face on a day to day basis and how it’s being managed. In episode 7, you’ll see what I mean. Episode 7 is the perfect description of how a perfectly normal day could immediately turn into a melting pot of utter shit and chaotic distress. </p>

          <p><b>It’s triggering, yet cathartic.</b> Triggering because last summer I wanted k*ll myself, cathartic because it was comforting to know that I’m not alone. </p>

          <p>A lot of my anxiety and depression has been surrounded by work lately and I can’t help but think that there are people out there that earn significantly more than cooks out there by working a desk job. Not to shit on desk jobs, that’s the dream, but we compromise and sacrifice a lot more than other industries would. It’s a high-earning industry, I guess I just don't feel it. <b>It’s like I have a personal vendetta against the industry.</b></p>

          <p>But I’m learning to understand that every job has different stresses. I chose this life so I’ve got to ride it out for a bit. I don’t know if that’s a healthy mindset to have, but I’d be lying if I said that my workplace is fun. The Bear helped me sort of rationalize and understand this industry a little bit more and why I’m lucky to be at the restaurant that I’m currently in. I see these guys more than I see my family; <b>the restaurant became my family.</b></p>

          <p>This almost sounds like a selfish newsletter, I’m not asking you to sympathize and feel sad for us. I just sort of want whoever’s reading this to gain an understanding as to what could be happening behind the counter. </p>
